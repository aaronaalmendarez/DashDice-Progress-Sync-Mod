# DashDice Progress Sync

DashDice Progress Sync keeps your level progress synced to DashDice while you play Geometry Dash.

## What It Syncs

- Normal progress (%)
- Practice progress (%)
- Attempts

## Quick Start

1. Generate your connection key on DashDice.
2. Open Geode settings for **DashDice Progress Sync**.
3. Paste your key and endpoint.
4. Play any level and exit; your progress is sent automatically.

## Why Use It

- No manual tracking
- Sync runs in the background
- If your server is offline, progress is queued and sent later

## Tip

For best account matching and long-term reliability, log into a Geometry Dash account before syncing.
